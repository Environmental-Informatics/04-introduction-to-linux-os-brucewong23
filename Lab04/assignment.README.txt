In part 6, I'm not sure how or if I can even capture any activity I did with the text I entered into the file, hopeful this part focus on putting contents in the file.

In part 9, the original file has the same content as what the instructor had, copied into designated folder, then sorted with default option and copied into the same folder.

In part 11, one file name was saved into the file since the question asked for 'the 20th last FILE' which is a singlar, hope my assumption is right.
