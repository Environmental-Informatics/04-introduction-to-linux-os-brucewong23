"What was your frame of mind in the seventeen days between then and the night your wife was murdered?" Andy's lawyer asked him.
"I was in great distress," Andy said calmly, coldly. Like a man reciting a shopping list he said that he had considered suicide, and had even gone so far as to purchase a gun in Lewiston on September 8th.
His lawyer then invited him to tell the jury what had happened after his wife left to meet Glenn Quentin on the night of the murders. Andy told them...and the impression he made was the worst possible.
